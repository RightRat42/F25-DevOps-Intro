## Task 1
Successful run: https://github.com/RightRat42/F25-DevOps-Intro/actions/runs/17922437241
The workflow runs on push to remote repo. 
Using ``runs-on`` field we can specify the OS that we want to run our actions on. Therefore we can make our *action* execute shell commands, which is demonstrated by the commands in the __github-actions-demo.yml__.
